# ESP32 ONE Node Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of a basic ONE node on ESP32 microcontroller, serving as an IoT endpoint in the ONE ecosystem.

## Development Setup
### Dependencies
- ../one.core - Core ONE functionality reference
- ../one.models - ONE data models reference
- ../one.baypass.replicant - ONE replication reference

### Build Configuration
- Babel configuration for @refinio package addressing:
  ```json
  {
    "plugins": [
      ["module-resolver", {
        "root": ["./src"],
        "alias": {
          "@refinio/one.core": "../one.core",
          "@refinio/one.models": "../one.models",
          "@refinio/one.baypass.replicant": "../one.baypass.replicant"
        }
      }]
    ]
  }
  ```

## Goals
1. Create a minimal ONE node implementation
2. Demonstrate basic ONE principles
3. Establish foundation for future expansion

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: ONE Object System
- Create C library (libonecore) for ONE data types
- Implement core object structures and operations
- Port essential type definitions from one.core
- Implement HTML+Microdata serialization
- Leverage ESP32 crypto hardware for object hashing

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure
- Set up ESP32 with necessary communications capabilities
- Implement basic storage handling
- Establish basic node identity
- Reference and adapt patterns from one.core where applicable
- Integrate with libonecore

### Phase 2: ONE Core Concepts
- Implement basic HTML+Microdata object storage
- Create simple transaction handling
- Implement basic Story and Plan objects
- Set up hash-based object referencing

### Phase 3: Communication
- Implement node discovery
- Set up basic peer communication
- Enable data synchronization capabilities
- Bridge interface to Node.js ONE implementation

### Phase 4: Integration
- Connect with other ONE nodes
- Implement basic Action handling
- Enable basic user interaction

## Technical Considerations
1. Memory constraints of ESP32
2. Persistent storage handling
3. Power management
4. Network security
5. Recovery mechanisms
6. Adaptation of ONE patterns to ESP32 constraints
7. Hardware crypto capabilities:
   - SHA-256 hardware acceleration
   - AES-128/192/256
   - RSA up to 4096 bits
   - Hardware Random Number Generator

## Initial Focus
Start with Phase 0: Creating libonecore and basic object system.
Study reference implementations from one.core and one.models for patterns to adapt.

## Questions to Address
1. Storage strategy for HTML+Microdata objects
2. Communication protocol details
3. Memory management approach
4. Security implementation
5. Adaptation strategy for ONE patterns to embedded environment
6. C library architecture and interface design
7. Bridge protocol between ESP32 and Node.js implementation
