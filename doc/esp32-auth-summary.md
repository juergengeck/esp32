# ESP32 Authentication and Communication Architecture
## Using Verifiable Credentials over QUIC

### Executive Summary
This document outlines an approach to secure ESP32 device communication using Verifiable Credentials (VCs) over QUIC transport protocol. The architecture replaces traditional TLS certificates with VCs while leveraging QUIC's built-in security features. This provides a more flexible, self-sovereign identity model for IoT devices while maintaining high performance and security standards.

### Core Architecture Components

#### 1. Identity and Authentication Layer
##### Verifiable Credentials
- **Device Identity**: Each ESP32 device receives a Decentralized Identifier (DID)
- **Credential Format**: W3C Verifiable Credentials standard
- **Minimal VC Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "DeviceCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:one:issuer",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "id": "did:one:device123",
      "type": "ESP32Device",
      "capabilities": ["quic", "secure-storage"]
    },
    "proof": {
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
      "proofValue": "..."
    }
  }
  ```

##### Authentication Flow
1. Device initialization with DID and minimal VC
2. Mutual authentication:
   - ESP32 verifies user/app credentials
   - ONE app verifies device credentials
3. Establishment of secure QUIC connection

#### 2. Transport Layer (QUIC)
##### Key Features Utilized
- Built-in TLS 1.3 security
- Multiplexed streams
- 0-RTT connection establishment
- Connection migration

##### QUIC Configuration for ESP32
```typescript
const QUIC_CONFIG = {
    maxStreams: 100,
    idleTimeout: 30_000,
    maxBidiStreams: 100,
    maxData: 10_000_000,
    activeConnectionIdLimit: 2
};
```

### Implementation Details

#### ESP32 Side
##### 1. VC Verification Module
```cpp
class VCAuthenticator {
    bool verifyCredential(const char* presentedVc);
    String generateProof();
    bool init(const char* deviceDid);
};
```
- Lightweight verification of presented credentials
- Minimal cryptographic operations
- Storage of essential device identity information

##### 2. QUIC Implementation
```cpp
class VCQuicServer {
    bool begin(const char* did);
    void handlePacket();
    bool verifyPeer(const char* peerVc);
};
```
- Uses lsquic for QUIC support
- Custom transport parameters for VC exchange
- Resource-optimized stream handling

#### ONE App Side
##### 1. Credential Management
```typescript
class VCIntegration {
    static async createDeviceCredential(deviceDid: string);
    static async verifyDeviceCredential(credential: VerifiableCredential);
}
```
- Creation and management of device credentials
- Integration with existing ONE certificate system
- Credential revocation handling

##### 2. QUIC Client
```typescript
class VCQuicClient {
    async connect(host: string, port: number);
    async sendData(data: Buffer);
}
```
- VC-based authentication
- Stream multiplexing
- Error handling and reconnection logic

### Security Considerations

#### 1. Device Security
- Private keys never leave the ONE app
- ESP32 stores minimal credential information
- Firmware validation using signed hashes
- Resource access control based on VC capabilities

#### 2. Communication Security
- End-to-end encryption via QUIC
- Mutual authentication using VCs
- Perfect forward secrecy
- Protection against replay attacks

#### 3. Credential Security
- Credential revocation mechanism
- Time-bound validity periods
- Capability-based access control
- Audit trail of credential usage

### Integration with ONE Architecture

#### 1. Authentication Flow
1. Device registration in ONE system
2. VC issuance and storage
3. Mutual authentication establishment
4. Secure QUIC channel creation

#### 2. Resource Access Control
- Based on VC capabilities
- Integrated with ONE's existing authorization system
- Granular access control per device/user

### Benefits and Considerations

#### Benefits
1. **Flexibility**: Easy credential management and rotation
2. **Performance**: Efficient QUIC transport with multiplexing
3. **Security**: Strong authentication with minimal device overhead
4. **Integration**: Seamless fit with ONE architecture

#### Considerations
1. **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU constraints on ESP32
2. **Network Requirements**: UDP port accessibility for QUIC
3. **Credential Management**: Lifecycle handling of VCs

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement credential rotation mechanism
2. Add support for selective disclosure in VCs
3. Develop group credential capabilities
4. Enhance QUIC stream utilization

### Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust, forward-looking approach to IoT device security. By combining VCs with QUIC transport, we achieve both strong security and high performance while maintaining compatibility with resource-constrained ESP32 devices.
